	  characters that dialog can handle. If DIALOG_MAXARGS is unset we
	  use the traditional 19500 characters. Removing hints when
	  we reach DIALOG_MAXARGS *ISN'T A BUG* is a *FIX*. Without that,
	  upgrade from slackware-X to slackware-X+1 will be impossible.
		. Added DIALOG_MAXARGS on slackpkg.conf

	- Renamed the "CHECKPKG" variable to "CHECKMD5" (and changed the 
	  relevant command line options; this is more appropriate for what

	  easier to tell the difference between it and CHECKGPG at a glance.
					(Thanks Robby Workman)
	- Added check to see if slackpkg.conf version matches slackpkg
	  version.
	- More changes in install-new's ChangeLog.txt parsing

2009 Sun May 03
---------------
	- Added generate-template, remove-template, and install-template 
	  commands. The first one creates a template with all official 
	  slackware packages installed in the machine. The template is saved 
	  in /etc/slackpkg/templates. You can copy this template to other
	  machines and install it with install-template.
	- Added a spinning bar to give visual feedback of slackpkg "thinking".
	- SPINNING is added to slackpkg.conf. It can enable (on) and
	  disable (off) the spinning bar.
	- Added USE_INCLUDES to manage whether template includes should be
	  processed by slackpkg.

	  slackpkg can change it automagically. If you need to override what 
	  slackpkg detects, set the variable in slackpkg.conf.
	- MAIN is now handled internally by slackpkg. You can no longer change
	  this variable using slackpkg.conf.
	- PKGMAIN is set by slackpkg to the appropriate value for your 
	  ARCH port.
	- SLACKKEY now can be set in slackpkg.conf. Usually slackpkg will 
	  handle this automagically.

	  array: PRIORITY. The contents of those five variables now are 
	  inside PRIORITY array.
	- Added support to Slackintosh with the inclusion of "mac" series.
	- Some changes in install-new's ChangeLog.txt parsing

	  tbz, tlz and txz brokes the local package list.
	- 2.71beta4!! Man, we don't stop!

2009 Fri Apr 10
---------------
	- Now use CHECKSUMS.md5 as primary source of package
	  names.
	- Check if FILELIST.TXT is newer than last update.
	  That will prevents you to accidentaly downgrade
	  your machine using an outdated mirror.
	- Added a lot of new security checks
		- check CHECKSUMS.md5 against CHECKSUMS.md5.asc
		- check FILELIST.TXT against CHECKSUMS.md5
		- check all downloaded .asc against CHECKSUMS.md5
			(CHECKSUMS.md5.asc is excluded of this check)

2009 Tue Apr 07
---------------
	- Added support to other package extensions.
	  Now slackpkg can handle tgz, tbz, tlz and txz.
	  Of course, this depends on pkgtools with the
	  same capabilities.

2009 Mon Mar 23
---------------
	- Put findutils to be upgraded before glibc-solibs.
	  I think this is wrong. But for some strange reason
	  findutils brokes if glibc is upgraded first.

	  (and -only_new_dotnew to command line). With that, only the
	  latest .new files will be checked by post-install function.
	- Added ONLY_NEW_DOTNEW and PKGMAIN description on slackpkg.conf
	  man-page.
	- Added "check-updates" on slackpkg man-page.

	- A new command line parser, much better than the older one.
	  Now you can override slackpkg.conf configurations from
	  command line:

		slackpkg -checkpkg=off upgrade-all

	  Will disable the checkpkg feature. Many slackpkg.conf
	  can be overrided using that. You can also specify a
	  different mirror, using -mirror=URL/
	- Additional check to see if "which" is there
	- Added "new-config" option, it will search for .new files
	  and ask to user what to do with them. (suggested by X-Gizmo)

2008 Wed Jan 07
---------------
	- Added BATCH and DEFAULT_ANSWER options in slackpkg.conf,
	  you can use those two to make automated upgrades without
	  human intervention. (suggested by Clayton and many others).

2008 Wed Jan 04
---------------

	- Included (I) to ignore duplicated files... well, this can
	  burn your computer... but who am I to don't let you do that?
				(Thanks Robby Workman, again)
	- Included httpd in hardcoded install-new files.
	- Bumped the version number to 2.61

2007 Sun May 27
---------------
	- Back to the xargs combo in dialog-functions. --file doesn't 
	  works in slackware 10.1.
	- Fix some bugs in file list generation. Some declarations
	  like:
		local VAR=`something`
	  doens't works well in older bash (in 10.1). This bug
	  generates a lot of "dialog" bugs. I hope they are fixed
	  now.
	- Better error handling in dialog-functions. Now we can
	  detect when dialog fails and print one error message. 

2007 Tue May 15
---------------
	- Added one / before ${NAMEPKG} in check md5sum. It prevents
	  a match with vim and vim-gvim (and possible other packages)
	  and subsequent m5sum errors.
			 (Reported by Diniz Bortolotto)
	- Swap some "ls" uses by -e to check if one file exists
	- Changed the way of error treatment. Now we have:
		. One log of what package gives error
		. What error happens in each package
		. Not install one package if the GPG signature
		  is OK but md5sum isn't (maybe a corrupted
		  package?)
		. Shows all logged errors when slackpkg
		  ends.

	- Make install-new to search only in the main slackware
	  series. No more /extra and /pasture packages
	- Changes in dialog functions. To prevent some strange
	  errors we use grep -m1 to use only the first match
	  and --file in dialog to prevent bizarre xargs
	  errors (reported by many)
	- Fixes in sanity-check function to discover
	  duplicated packages. (Thanks Sasha Alexandr)

2007 Sat Mar 17
---------------
	- Change VERSION to 2.52 instead 2.52beta
	- Added a test do detect old slackpkg.conf versions
	- Added hardcoded dialog and aaa_terminfo in install-new
	- Released slackpkg 2.52!!

2007 Mon Mar 12 
---------------
	- Changing NOGPG to CHECKGPG. Is more coherent with the other
	  options. Thanks Robby to point that.
	- Many update and grammar fixes in documentation.
		(Thanks again Robby Workman!)

2007 Mon Jan 05
---------------
	- Fix many errors in "install-new". It didn't found any
	  package with [A-Z] or [0-9] in his names.
	- Still in "install-new", now we can detect more new packages,
	  the awk script is a lot better now.
	- Correct the .tgz parsing in pkglist.awk, using \.tgz instead.
	- Newer (and i hope, good) man-pages.

2006 Wed Nov 08
---------------
	- Fixed the "upgrade" package parsing. It was going wrong
	  with nn and glib packages.
		(Reported by Ralph Alvy)
	- Fixed "reinstall" it was ignoring the blacklist and given
	  wrong packages to reinstall.
	- Now blacklist can handle directories beginning with a / and not
	  with ./ (very better, and this is the needed behavior).
	- Accept the list of packages from a file
		(e.g.: slackpkg upgrade /etc/slackpkg/files)
	  We accept relative (./something, ../something) and absolute 
	  paths (/something).
	- Release 2.51beta

2006 Sun Oct 29
---------------
	- Fixes to install/upgrade (it was broked when i change the
	  tmplist). Now it's OK
	- Fixes in remove and reinstall, they are showing duplicated
	  entries in the list. Now it's OK
	- Fix in download... it was total crazy! Now it's OK
	- Added install-new.awk and improve the ChangeLog.txt parser
	  now we don't have any package hardcoded.
	- Fix in upgrade-all to remove the unused variable NAME now we can use
	  the data in pkglist. 
	- Minor fix in clean-system.
	- Change the variable's scope to "local" in many functions

2006 Sat Oct 28
---------------
	- Change the tmplist format to be the same as pkglist
	- New functions to make the package list with that we now can:
		- Handle multiple files in the command line.
		  (e.g.: slackpkg upgrade kernel x11 lsof)
		- Use the package series as the pattern, without the
		  trailing / hack.
		  (e.g.: slackpkg remove a)
		- "download" don't use the blacklist. The user now can
		  download one blacklisted package.
	- Release slackpkg 2.5beta

2006 Fri Oct 27
---------------
	- A lot of job rebuilding (again) the package parser. This
	  is the logic that search for apropriate packages and see if
	  that packages are or not in blacklist. This is the harder
	  piece of slackpkg development. For now we made:
		. a new pkglist.awk that creates a really new and
		  more featureful pkglist. The new slackpkg can't work
		  anymore with the old pkglist.
		. One blacklist function that can match: 
			. directories
		 	. package-names
			. package-names with version
		  	. package-names with version and arch
			. package-names with version, arch and release.
		. This fix a problem with some packages being override
		  by others with "similar" names.
		  (e.g.: k3b being override by k3b-i18n)

2006 Thu Oct 26
---------------
	- Create the WORKDIR variable and put all package and file lists
	  there. Now ppl that wants to mount / read-only can do that.
		(Thanks to Trevor Caira)
	- Added a little bit of sanity in slackpkg.conf. Now all options
	  uses "on" to be activated and "off" to be deactivated. No more
	  "1", "0", "On", "ON" and all the chaos that we had before.
		(Thanks to Robby Workman) 
	- Added one FIFTH directory. Now people can use /testing as a
	  repository, too (of course this will break a lot of things)
	- Added one MAIN variable. This is used instead slackware to
	  identify the main distro directory.
	- Move /etc/slackpkg/filelist.awk to /usr/libexec/slackpkg. This
	  is the correct place to a executable.

2006 Mon Aug 28
---------------
	- Fixed a problem with upgrade-all when try to upgrade directly
	  from 10.2 to 11rc3. xargs can only handle 20k lines.

	- More two patches from Marek
	- One to show the diff between "something" and "something.new".
		This make the life more easier

	- Fix the default action in:

		(Thanx Marek Wodzinski)
	- Changed version number to 1.3.1

	  new slackware releases -;)
		(Thanx Jorge Arellano Cid)

2004 Fri Oct 29

	  > lead to bugs
	- Added aaa_base too...

2004 Mon Apr 05
---------------

	- Another fix in "search" bug. (Thanx toledo)

	- Fixed some bugs added by the regex changes.
	- Added a test to "first time running". Now slackpkg give some

	  GPG key, the key will be downloaded in "slackpkg update"

2004 Wed Mar 24
---------------
	- Fixed many regex bugs and changes a lot of "greps".
	- Fixed ls bugs -- changed to "ls -1" to stop multi column lists
	- Added sed substitutions to fix problems with + in packagenames
	- Altered awk script in info case statement to properly format output
	  when more than one result is returned 
	- Changed showlist function so that only Y/y will continue, any other
	  character will cleanup -- safeguards against a wrong key pressed
			(all these fix cames from mRgOBLIN)
	- Another feature to "non-root" users... now they can use "info"

2004 Mon Mar 22
---------------
	- Search function all overwrited by mRgOBLIN. The new function fixes
	  some bugs and add a feature, telling to the user what package needs
	  upgrade and the name of newer package version.
        - Minor changes in some error messages
        - Now "non-root" users can use "search" without install Slackware GPG
          Key...

2004 Thu Mar 18
---------------
	- Put an error message when md5sum or gpg doesn't match.
			(Thanx mRgOBLIN)

	  Now it's correct.
			(Thanx mRgOBLIN, for the bug report and the tip of fix)

2004 Mon Mar 01
---------------
	- Added GPG function. Now slackpkg check all packages against its
	  .asc file. This option are enabled by default, if you doesn't like
	  that, you can change the configuration in /etc/slackpkg/slackpkg.conf

2004 Thu Feb 26
---------------
	- Fixed a bug with VIM package (yes, the bug affect only
	  vim package...)
	- A little change in makelist function. Now we got our speed
	  back... when fixed duplicate packages the fix make slackpkg
	  more slow (4 minutes to make list for "slackpkg upgrade slackware"). 
	  Now we doesn't have duplicated packages and have back our normal
	  speed (1 minute to "slackpkg upgrade slackware" list)
	- Change version on all places to 1.03.1

2004 Tue Feb 18
---------------
	- Now when we show a big package list, you can scroll with "more"
	  and can see all packages
	- Bug fix! Something changed in FILELIST.TXT and slackpkg brokes
	  all package lists. Now it's ok.
		(Thanx to chvt and Steven De Kock)
	- New man-page provided by Rob. Thanx!
	- Changed VERSION to 1.03

2004 Tue Feb 10
---------------
	- We added a new system to make easy add new functions in slackpkg.
	  You only needs put your new function in a shell script and that
	  script under /usr/share/slackpkg/functions.d

	  With that, if you want GPG checking (example), you only needs
	  add one checkgpg function and rewrite/change the getpkg. It's
	  a nice way of extend slackpkg.

	- Changed /usr/share to /usr/libexec. It makes more sense.
			(Thanx thefallen)
	- Fixed blacklist duplicate packages problem. Blacklist doesn't use
	  the default makelist function (now it uses).
			(Thanx chvt for bug reports)

2004 Thu Feb 06
---------------
	- Corrected a little bug in makelist option. Some packages are
	  duplicated in the list. Now it's correct.
	- Put "update" in "case-esac". It is the only option in a "if-fi"

2004 Thu Feb 05
---------------
	- Version are wrong in VERSION var. Now it's good.
	- A lot of design changes. The "new" output style is a big mistake.
	  I am reverting slackpkg to the old one.
	- We are splitting slackpkg in two parts. One with slackpkg functions
	  and other with the main program itself. It's really good.
	- Put all options in a big "case-esac" instead multiple "if-fi"

2004 Mon Feb 02
---------------
	- A new "sleep" test to solve problems in Slackware 9.1
	- One tr -d "\r" to fix a bug in pkglist generation
		(Thanx to Anatol)
	- Added a new "clean" of tmp files in the slackpkg startup. It fixes
	  some ugly errors (slackpkg never-ends, slackpkg duplicate packages,
	  etc...)
		(Thanx Lorn, toledo and gar0t0)
	- Little changes in "info" now you will give an error if try to see
	  a "generic" info. "info" needs one package-name.

2004 Fri Jan 30
---------------
	- Put a spinning bar when making one slow action. Thanx to toledo!!!
	  The code for spinning bar works really fine, and now our users can

	- Edit a lot of small things in everywhere to use spinning bar.
	- man-page, README and other docs are "updated".
	- fixed some sleep problems in slackware 8.1/9.0, now our program call
	  an internal sleep function

2004 Wed Jan 21
---------------
	- Fixed "update" option. When we work with local dirs, the PACKAGES.TXT
	  are not "downloaded".

2004 Mon Jan 19
---------------
	- New option added! slackpkg info package can tell to you the 
	  information about that package.
	- Correct some small bugs in cutpkg (very small bugs... i can detect 
	  they only now!!!)
	- Changed update option to download PACKAGES.TXT too...

2004 Fri Jan 17
---------------
	- Changed the default wget to not show any info. Now we got a much more
	  cleaner output on screen.
	- Corrected some bugs in new clean output system

2004 Mon Jan 12
---------------
	- Changed the ChangeLog file format.
	- Corrected a bug in blacklist option. It's the same bug that happenned
	  in "download" option. The bug are reported by Toledo (again)
	- Now slackpkg can "search" files in /extra and /pasture too

Tue Nov 11 - Fixed a little problem with duplicated packages in reinstall
	     function.
	   - Corrected a bug in download option. It asks to "download" from
	     an empty line. Now it's fixed  (bug report by Toledo)

Mon Nov 10 - Changed version to 1.00
		. we have 1.00beta, 1.00beta1 and 1.00beta2 in internal tests
	   - Many, many changes in the backend...
		. The package scan are completely rewroted. Now we can
		  make the package list 30% faster than old code.
		. Now we have a lot of functions. The code are much more
		  flexible and readable
		. Thanx to Jochem Kossen!
	   - New "download" function.

	   - Upgraded the man-page and README

Thu Sep 25 - Updated man-page to show blacklist option
	   - Updated README to show blacklist option and to show the correct
	     release number.
	   - Correct the "usage" message to include blacklist option
	   - Ok, we remove kernel-* from blacklist and put in here a 
	     message telling automated upgrade kernel-* isn't a good idea.
	     A lot of people tell me blacklist need to be empty... and i
	     approve that idea.
	   - Change the way of how detect packages that will be upgraded or
	     reinstalled. Old way thinks: package-1.2.3-i386-1 are the same
	     of package-1.2.3-i386-12345, now it's correct.
	   - Now slackpkg checks if the package is already in 
	     /var/cache/packages before to download. If it's in cache, only
	     upgrade|install|reinstall, don't make a new download.
		. Thanx Leandro Toledo

Wed Sep 24 - Added "blacklist" command, to put packages in blacklist.
	     put all i18n packages manually is terrible.

	     ready -:) (Thanx Cubano)

	     download.
