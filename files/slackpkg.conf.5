.TH SLACKPKG.CONF 5 "June 2022" slackpkg-15.0.10 ""
.SH NAME
.B slackpkg.conf
\- Configuration data for slackpkg

.SH DESCRIPTION

The slackpkg.conf file contains information for
.B slackpkg
(8), an automated tool for managing Slackware Linux packages.

The slackpkg.conf file is a sequence of shell script variables, and each 
variable controls one aspect of slackpkg.  Comments begin with the # 
character and end at end of the line, and comments may appear anywhere
inside the slackpkg.conf file.  If some variable appears more than once 
in the file, slackpkg will use the value that was defined last.

Many variables can be overridden by options passed to slackpkg on the command
line. If you need to override the value of 
.B VARIABLE 
, pass 
.B -variable=value 
on the command line just before the slackpkg action. Multiple variables may
be overridden.

EXAMPLE:  slackpkg -batch=on -default_answer=y upgrade-all

For configuration options that have only two states, possible values are
either "on" or "off" unless otherwise indicated.

The different configuration options are:

.TP 5
.B ARCH
.br
Chooses the system architecture. Usually Slackpkg can find the correct
value using "uname -m". The valid values are:

.ds title MACHINE\t\tVALID ARCH VALUES
.ds arm ARM\t\t\tarm
.ds aarch64 AArch64\t\taarch64
.ds x86 x86 (32bits)\ti386, i486, i586 and i686
.ds x86_64 x86 (64bits)\tx86_64
.ds ppc PowerPC\t\tpowerpc
.ds s390 S/390\t\t390 
.in +5
.B \*[title]
.br
\*[arm]
.br
\*[aarch64]
.br
\*[x86]
.br
\*[x86_64]
.br
\*[ppc]
.br
\*[s390]
.in

The default value of 
.B ARCH 
depends on your architecture.

.TP 5
.B SLACKKEY
.br
Slackpkg checks the package signature file (.asc) against the GPG signature
of the project. Different ports of Slackware can have different signatures,
and Slackpkg tries to find the correct one based on the architecture of your
system. If the automatically-detected 
.B SLACKKEY
isn't correct, you can change it using this option.

The default value of 
.B SLACKKEY
depends on your Slackware port. 

.TP 5
.B TEMP
.br
Defines the location to which slackpkg will download the packages before
installing/upgrading them. 

The default value of 
.B TEMP 
is /var/cache/packages.

.TP 5
.B WORKDIR
.br
Defines the directory for package lists, file lists, and other information
used by slackpkg as it works.  Do not change the value of this variable
unless you know what you are doing.

The default value of 
.B WORKDIR 
is /var/lib/slackpkg.

.TP 5
.B DOWNLOADER
.br
Selects the download application slackpkg will use to fetch files.
Current options are "curl" or "wget".

The default value of
.B DOWNLOADER
is "wget"

.TP 5
.B CURLFLAGS
.br
Selects special options for curl. If you need to use multiple options,
remember to put them between double quotes.

.TP 5
.B WGETFLAGS
.br
Selects special options for wget.  If you need to use multiple options,
remember to put them between double quotes.  

The default value of 
.B WGETFLAGS 
is "\--passive-ftp"

.TP 5
.B DELALL
.br
If set to "on", all downloaded files will be removed after slackpkg performs
install or upgrade (this does NOT have any impact when slackpkg is run with
"download").  If set to "off", the files will be kept in the directory
defined in 
.B TEMP 
(as described above). 

The default value of 
.B DELALL 
is "on". 
.br
From command line, you can use -delall=value.

.TP 5
.B CHECKMD5
.br
Enables (on) or disables (off) the checking of MD5 checksums of all downloaded 
packages before installing or upgrading them.  

The default value of 
.B CHECKMD5
is "on".
.br
From command line, you can use -checkmd5=value.

.TP 5
.B CHECKGPG
.br
Enables (on) or disables (off) the check of GPG signature for each package 
before install or upgrade.

The default value of 
.B CHECKGPG 
is "on".
.br
From command line, you can use -checkgpg=value.

.TP 5
.B CHECKSIZE
.br
Enables (on) or disables (off) the check of available disk space for each
package before install or upgrade.

The default value of 
.B CHECKSIZE
is "off".
.br
From command line, you can use -checksize=value.

.TP 5
.B PKGMAIN
.br
Defines the main distribution directory. Usually, you don't need to worry 
about this variable, as Slackpkg tries to find it based on your architecture.
However, if you need to change it, then include this variable in your 
slackpkg.conf.  This should always be the directory which contains the 
Slackware package set series (A, AP, D, E, F, ...).

Default: depends on Slackware port

.TP 5
.B PRIORITY 
.br
This array selects the priority at which directories on the mirror will have
when slackpkg looks for packages.  If a package is found in more than one 
place, the package in first directory gets priority, then second, then third, 
then fourth and finally, the package found in last listed directory. You can 
use %PKGMAIN to use the contents of PKGMAIN variable.

Default values (in order): patches %PKGMAIN extra pasture testing

.TP 5
.B POSTINST
.br
Enables (on) or disables (off) slackpkg's post-installation features, such 
as checking for new (*.new) configuration files and new kernel images, and 
prompts you for what it should do.  

The default value of 
.B POSTINST 
is "on". 
.br
From command line, you can use -postinst=value.
 
.TP 5
.B ONLY_NEW_DOTNEW 
.br
When 
.B POSTINST
is set to "on", slackpkg will search for all .new files inside /etc and 
prompt the user for what to do with them.  However, some users prefer to 
see only the .new files installed in slackpkg's last execution, so if 
this applies to you, set
.B ONLY_NEW_DOTNEW 
to "on".

The default value of 
.B ONLY_NEW_DOTNEW 
is "off". Only change this if you know what are you doing...
.br
From command line, you can use -only_new_dotnew=value.

.TP 5
.B ORIG_BACKUPS 
.br
During integration of .new files during the post installation phase, original 
files are backed up to a file name with a .orig extension.  To prevent this, 
set this option to "off" and note that you will no longer have a copy of the 
content of the file prior to it being replaced by the .new version.

The default value of 
.B ORIG_BACKUPS
is "on".  Only change this if you are sure you don't want backups of
overwritten files.
.br
From the command line, you can use -orig_backups=value.

.TP 5
.B ONOFF
.br
The 
.B ONOFF 
variable sets the initial behavior of the dialog interface. 
If you set this to "on" then all packages will be selected by default. 
If you prefer the opposite option (all unchecked), then set this to "off". 

The default value of 
.B ONOFF 
is "on". 
.br
From command line, you can use -onoff=value.

.TP 5
.B DOWNLOAD_ALL
.br
If this variable is set to "on", all files will be downloaded before the 
requested operation (install or upgrade) is performed.   If set to "off", 
then the files will be downloaded and the operation (install/upgrade) performed
one by one.

The default value of 
.B DOWNLOAD_ALL 
is "off". 
.br
From command line, you can use -download_all=value.

.TP 5
.B DIALOG
.br
Enables (on) or disables (off) the dialog interface. 

The default value of 
.B DIALOG 
is "on". 
.br
From command line, you can use -dialog=value.

.TP 5
.B DIALOG_MAXARGS
.br
Set the max number of characters that will be send to "dialog". If this number
is reached in upgrade, slackpkg removes the information about current installed
version of each package. If even without this information the number is reached
again, slackpkg returns an error to the user.

If
.B DIALOG_MAXARGS
is unset, 19500 is the default value.
.br
From command line, you can use -dialog_maxargs=value.

.TP 5
.B BATCH
.br
Enables (on) or disables (off) the non-interactive mode.  When run in batch
mode, slackpkg will not prompt the user for anything; instead, all questions 
will get 
.B DEFAULT_ANSWER 
(see below).  
.br
If you perform an upgrade using this mode, you will need to run 
"slackpkg new-config" later to find and merge .new files.

The default value of 
.B BATCH 
is "off". 
.br
From command line, you can use -batch=value.

.TP 5
.B DEFAULT_ANSWER
.br
This is the default answer to questions when slackpkg prompts the user for
some information.  This is used only in non-interactive mode (when 
.B BATCH
is "yes" or the user turns batch mode on via the command line); otherwise, 
this variable has no effect.
.br
Valid values are "y" or "n".

The default value of 
.B DEFAULT_ANSWER 
is "n". 
.br
From command line, you can use -default_answer=value.

.TP 5
.B USE_INCLUDES
.br
Slackpkg templates can include other templates. This reduces the package
duplication in many templates, but it can be a problem if you want to remove
only a specific template. You can disable the #include parsing by setting
this option to "off". 

The default value of
.B USE_INCLUDES
is "on".
.br
From command line, you can use -use_includes=value.

.TP 5
.B SPINNING
.br
When Slackpkg is doing an activity that takes some time, it gives visual
feedback with a spinning bar. If you don't like the spinning bar, it can be 
disabled by setting this option to "off".

The default value of
.B SPINNING
is "on".
.br
From command line, you can use -spinning=value.
